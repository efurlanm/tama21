# HPC approach in Python environment using Numba compiler

This repository contains examples of HPC approaches in Python environment to a 5-point stencil test problem, using the high-performance Python compiler Numba, running on the Santos Dumont (SD) supercomputer, and also includes examples running on Google Colab (GC). The implementations are in the Jupyter Notebook files.
